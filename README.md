# App Id Sample JS application

The Getting Started tutorial for Node.js uses this sample application to provide you with a sample workflow for working and hosting your applicatio with APP ID on IBM Cloud ; you set up a development environment, deploy an app locally and on the cloud

The Node.js app uses [Express Framework](https://expressjs.com) and [Cloudant noSQL DB service](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db) or the [MongoDB Service](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/) to add information to a database and then return information from a database to the UI. To learn more about how the app connects to Cloudant, see the [Cloudant library for Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudant).



## Before you begin

You'll need a [IBM Cloud account](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads), and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
